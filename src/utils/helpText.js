export const helpText = `<b>"Manuscript check"</b> identifies which words from a list appear in the Manuscript/Answers text.<br>
<b>"Word list check"</b> compares two word lists to find mismatches.<br><br>

Select a mode in the top-left corner.<br><br>

Paste the Manuscript (<i>and Answers, if needed</i>) into the left field.<br><br>

Paste the word list (<i>e.g., Glossary</i>) into the right field and click <b>"Check"</b>.<br><br>

If both fields are filled, the <b>"Results"</b> section appears.<br><br>

In Manuscript check, the word list is cleaned automatically (<i>e.g., removes (m), (f), extra spaces</i>).<br><br>

In Word list check, no changes are made to the input.<br><br>

Use the filter options in Results to view: All words, Found words, or Not found words.<br>
Words are only marked as <b>"found"</b> if they appear exactly as written in the list. If you want to see where a found word appears in the text, click on it in the list — it will be highlighted in yellow.<br><br>

Partial matches (<i>e.g., tener inside mantener</i>), words in parentheses, or those followed by slashes won’t be detected.<br><br>

Double-click a word to edit it. If a word is marked as not found, you can try checking other forms (<i>e.g., change comer to como</i>).<br>
A hint below shows if the new form exists in the text. If found and saved, it moves to the <b>"Found"</b> list automatically.`
